# arcnews

A Docker image file for deploying Hacker News like sites, based on the latest version of [Anarki](https://github.com/arclanguage/anarki) code and [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) language runtime.

This Dockerfile is inspired by [docker-hn](https://github.com/fauria/docker-hn), and I have made some changes to make it work with the latest version of Anarki code.
